# OSIPI-ASL-code-contributions
ASL code contributions for Arterial Spin Labeling data processing, collected within the Open-Source Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI)

In an effort to standardize, reduce duplicated development, and improve the reproducibility of ASL pipelines. Task force 2.2 of the Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI) has developed a library of open-source functions, and scripts for Arterial Spin Labeled (ASL) perfusion imaging preprocessing and analysis. This is aimed for developers of ASL perfusion methods looking for specific functionalities or development templates, or who want to share their own in-house code with others.
The collected source code was organized and documented so as to support the open library development.

We received contributions from different groups, including 
	1. ASLtbx and DL-ASL from the University of Maryland School of Medicine
	2. ASL-Angio reader and super-selective pCASL CBF from the Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf
	3. QuBIc groups from the Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering
	4. ASL-MRICloud from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
	5. BASIL and Quantiphyse（ASL) from the University of Nottingham, Clinical ASL from UMC Utrecht
	6. DeepASL from the Technical University of Munich
	7. ExploreASL from a team of international researchers (https://sites.google.com/view/exploreasl/team?authuser=0).  

The source code has been reviewed by our team and the functionalities are being separated and documented. However, one function  may have dependences on other functions within the repository. So, in this git repository, all functions will be preseneted within their original repo.
