# ASL Optimization and CBF Visualization
By: Kevin Xie

Affiliations: The Kennedy Krieger Institute, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA

MATLAB Version: 9.14.0.2286388 (R2023a) Update 3

This repository contains the code and installation package for an application I designed to assist in the preparation and visualization of MRI images.

## Key Features
  - Intuitive and User-Friendly Interface
  - Streamlined Data Preparation Process
  - Interactive Masking for Accurate CBF Visualization
  - Comprehensive Display Options

### Toolbox
  - The functions used within the app can be found in ‘toolbox’
  - Optimizes ASL_Preparation and ASL_CBF functions
  - Utilizes spm8 library

## **Getting Started**
### [Installing](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/blob/main/App_Installer.mlappinstall) the App

To install the app, click [here](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/blob/main/App_Installer.mlappinstall) and then click on "View raw." When prompted, click "Install."

After you have installed the app, it will be located in "Apps" on your MATLAB window. To open the app, simply click on the Icon.

### Download Necessary [Functions](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/tree/main/toolbox)

After you have downloaded the application into MATLAB, you will need to download several functions to go along with it.

Download every file located inside ["toolbox."](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/tree/main/toolbox) Be sure to organize all the functions into a new folder, and then set it as the "Current Folder" on MATLAB.

### Organizing Data

If you have data, make sure to organize each scan into different folders. You may also use and [download example data.](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/blob/main/Sample%20Data.zip) Once you have downloaded the zip file, make sure to unzip it.

***After completing these steps, the MATLAB application will be ready for use.***

### Other Methods
Another method is to directly [download the applications code](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/blob/main/ASL_ProjectCode.m) and run the script (.m) in the "Editor" Tab. 

***However, you still have to download the necessary files from the toolbox***

## **App Preview**
### Home Screen
The home screen simplifies the data preparation process into two button clicks. From this screen, users may also access various visualization tools.

### Mask
This screen allows users to hand-draw regions of interest. These masks will be saved and then used to display CBF images, reducing noise and allowing for more accurate analysis.

### Display Options
The app also provides a variety of display options. All images displayed within the app can be saved, cropped, etc.
