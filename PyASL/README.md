**PyASL** is an open-source Python library for processing arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI data, developed under the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program for the [ISMRM OSIPI Task Force 2.2](https://osipi.ismrm.org/task-forces/task-force-2-2/).

It integrates multiple community-validated ASL tools, originally in MATLAB, and supports both human and preclinical pipelines. PyASL includes modules for ASL-MRICloud, ASLtbx, DL-ASL, Oxford ASL, preclinical multi-TI PASL, and preclinical pCASL, harmonized with ASL-BIDS input format.

## Features

- ðŸ§  Read both human and preclinical ASL data format
- ðŸ“‚ _(NEW!)_ Zero programming knowledge required for running a pipeline
- ðŸ§© _(NEW!)_ Mix & match preprocessing steps across different pipelines
- âž• _(NEW!)_ Easy plug-in for adding new preprocessing steps
- ðŸ“˜ [Tutorials and Documentation](https://pyasl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
